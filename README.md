# doubleBeamforming
code for traditional method and fast method for double beamforming of ambient seismic noise, with example workflow on US Array data

# Use the rules in the Makefile (in order) to 

# The important part of the new algorithm is in DBFFuncs.py, 
# and examples of its use are in newDBF.py

# These codes were written and tested using: 
# Python 3.7.3
# Numpy version 1.16.2
# Scipy version 1.2.1 (used for fftpack)
# Obspy version 1.1.0

# doubleBeamforming/data
This is where data will be written after it is pulled from the IRIS repository. After these data are preprocessed, the preprocessed versions of the files in 4 hour windows will be written into this folder. 

Also, a set of files describing the latitude and longitude of each sensor to be worked with (by name) is provided. The array patch name (A or B) and the number of sensors (all just copies of 9 sensors per patch for scalability testing) is in the file name. Files are named like coordinatesA18.txt for 18 sensors in array patch A.
